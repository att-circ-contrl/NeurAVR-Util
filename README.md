# Attention Circuits Control Laboratory - Support Libraries for NeurAVR Devices
# README documentation.
Written by Christopher Thomas.


## Overview

The "NeurAVR" library is a bare-bones framework for writing firmware for
Atmel AVR devices (such as Arduino boards). This repository contains support
libraries intended to make it easier to write test harnesses and high-level
interfaces for such devices.


## Repository Contents

* `manual` -- Documentation.
* `libs-perl` -- Low-level libraries for manipulating NeurAVR-based devices
from Perl scripts.

(**FIXME** -- Add a Matlab library if Matlab-based control scripts have enough
reusable code.)
